<h1>Signal Generator</h1>
<h6>in this project you will find a code that works on generating some signlas like (square, triangle, sawtooth & sine) from 8051 microcontroller, those signals are important and most widely used for speed control of motors</h6>
<h6>we used assembly language as the default programming language for some reasons:</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Learning architecture of MCU in depth</li>
  <li>Full control of te code</li>
  <li>Get familliar with the processor's registers and SFR(special function registers)</li>
</ul>
